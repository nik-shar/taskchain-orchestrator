AI ENGINEER PROFILE
AI-focused engineer with hands-on experience in LLM-enabled orchestration systems, RAG pipelines, data-centric ML workflows, and production deployment. Strong in building reliable AI backends with deterministic fallbacks, schema-driven tool execution, and cloud-ready architecture.

EXPERIENCE
Turing - Delivery Data Scientist (Full-Time) | Remote | Jun 2025 - Present
- Built large-scale data pipelines for training and validation datasets across OCR and education ML use cases.
- Designed structured annotation workflows for SAT QA datasets, video event labeling, and book page to LaTeX/HTML conversion.
- Implemented Python-based data quality checks, preprocessing, and semi-automated labeling pipelines using JSON schemas.

Avkalan Labs - IoT Machine Learning Engineer Intern | Remote | May 2024 - Aug 2024
- Deployed TinyML models on ESP32 with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers and emlearn for real-time inference.
- Optimized embedded inference pipelines and memory usage for constrained edge hardware.

SELECTED AI PROJECTS
Taskchain Agent Orchestrator (FastAPI, LangGraph, OpenAI, PostgreSQL, SQLite FTS5, Chroma, Docker, GCP) | 2025 - Present
- Built an agentic orchestration system with explicit `plan -> retrieve -> execute -> verify` workflow and strict Pydantic tool schemas.
- Implemented hybrid RAG retrieval over incident and issue history using SQLite FTS + vector retrieval (Chroma) with reciprocal-rank fusion and deterministic fallback paths.
- Built and queried a local retrieval corpus of 13k+ documents (14k+ searchable chunks) for previous-issue grounding.
- Added verification gates for evidence quality, citation requirements, incident-policy grounding, and runtime telemetry for planner/executor fallback visibility.
- Persisted task and run artifacts in PostgreSQL (`tasks` and `task_runs` JSONB) for traceability and debugging.
- Productionized deployment to Google Cloud Run with Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Build using automated deployment scripts.

IoT Sensor Data Aggregation and Visualization (FastAPI, React, ESP32) | Jan 2025 - Present
- Developed FastAPI backend and React dashboard for real-time multi-sensor telemetry visualization.
- Built modular REST APIs for scalable multi-node sensor communication.

6-DOF Robotic Arm with Computer Vision (YOLOv11) | IIT Roorkee | Aug 2023 - Jan 2024
- Built autonomous object detection and sorting pipeline integrating robotics control and computer vision.
- Selected as Top 21 Finalist in Flipkart Grid 5.0 Robotics Challenge.

LEADERSHIP
Technical Head - Models and Robotics Section, IIT Roorkee | May 2024 - Present
- Led a 50+ member team and managed INR 4 lakh budget for robotics research/prototyping initiatives.
- Organized workshops, hackathons, and competitions; secured 1st Prize in Ware Wizard (Cognizance, IIT Roorkee).

Competitive Programming | LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks | Jul 2024 - Present
- Solved 400+ DSA problems; max LeetCode rating: 1787.
